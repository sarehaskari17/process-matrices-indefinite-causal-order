# process-matrices-indefinite-causal-order
Simulation of the causal inequality and its violation using a toy model inspired by the Oreshkov–Costa–Brukner process matrix framework. Includes a causal game simulator, noncausal correlations, and visual demonstration of indefinite causal order.

> 📝 **A small note for readers**  
> I originally made these notes and small simulations a few months ago. They were scattered across different notebooks and loose files,
> so I finally found some free time to clean everything up, organize it properly, and share it here
> on GitHub.  
>
> I hope you find these notes as enjoyable and helpful as they were for me while learning.  
> Feel free to reach out if you want to discuss ideas or share suggestions!
