# process-matrices-indefinite-causal-order
Simulation of the causal inequality and its violation using a toy model inspired by the Oreshkov–Costa–Brukner process matrix framework. Includes a causal game simulator, noncausal correlations, and visual demonstration of indefinite causal order.

You will later add:
- `toy_model.py` (optional: simple matrix-based simulation)
- `plots/` (figures for the PDF)

## 🧠 Theory Summary (very short)

- Define process matrices  
- Show how they generalize quantum channels  
- Introduce the Oreshkov–Costa–Brukner causal inequality  
- Explain what it means to “violate” causal order  

(Full derivation will be in the PDF.)

## 🔍 Goals of This Mini-Project

- Provide an operational understanding of indefinite causal order  
- Show explicit causal/noncausal correlations  
- Demonstrate how process matrices differ from standard quantum circuits  
- Build intuition for applications in quantum information and computation
